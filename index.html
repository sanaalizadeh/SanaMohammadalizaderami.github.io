    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently working as an Export and Business Development Specialist at [Company Name]. 
    Alongside my main role, I collaborate on Research and Development (R&D) projects. 
    I assist the Business Development Manager and handle responsibilities such as patent registration, 
    product development, competitor product analysis, pricing strategies, and product simulation using Python 
    before the operational production phase.</p>

    <p>I am highly curious and passionate about learning; 
    I often find it difficult to rest until completing tasks that I am enthusiastic about.</p>

    <p>I obtained my Master's degree in Biochemistry from the University of Tabriz in 2024. 
    My thesis focused on studying the effect of folic acid on Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) 
    using experimental methods, molecular docking, and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis. 
    I have a strong interest in molecular dynamics simulation and drug design research.</p>
